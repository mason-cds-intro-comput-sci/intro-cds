## A guided tour of RStudio Server's default interface

In the last tutorial, we learned how to log in into RStudio Server. In this tutorial, we will understand the different options and their uses which RStudio Server provides.

### RStudio Server sub-windows

When you log in into RStudio Server, you will be able to see four sub-windows. 

* The upper left window is for creating, running, and saving scripts which consist of a series of commands that are to be executed in sequence. This window is also used for viewing data sets.

* The window at the lower left is the Console, where individual commands are entered and executed, and the results are shown. When a script is run from the editor, the output will appear in the Console window.

* The window at the upper right shows available data sets and objects when the Environment tab is selected, and it shows previously run commands when the History button is selected. It also provides you information about connections and Git.

* The window at the lower right shows files and folders in the user's R folder in the image below, but this window also is used to display Help responses, and for displaying graphs and plots generated by R.  

<img src="img/tour_step_1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### File tab

The RStudio File menu contains many of the standard functions of a File menu in any other software or program – New File, Open File, Save, Print. You can also Knit a document by selecting Knit document option from file tab. 

<img src="img/tour_step_2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Edit tab

Using Edit menu users can perform Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, and Redo. The Edit menu is also very helpful in locating code or commands previously used. Featuring Go to Line…, Find…, and Replace and Find, users can quickly edit or replace RStudio code. The Edit menu additionally has the command Clear Console which allows users to wipe the Console clean. Clear Console does not affect the Source, Environment/History, or Miscellaneous tabs. 

<img src="img/tour_step_3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Code tab

The Code menu has commands used for working with code. Similar to the Edit menu, Code offers Jump To… for quick access to a specific code. Here you can rework the appearance of your code with Reformat Code, and where functions and variables may be removed with Extract Function and Extract Variable. The Code menu also provides commands for running the code with Run Selected Line(s), Re-Run Previous, and Run Region.

<img src="img/tour_step_4.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### View tab

The View menu is focused on how the user sees their RStudio workspace. This menu allows you to choose which tab you want to view, as well as where the mouse should be focused. Panes focus on zoom abilities of RStudio and enable users to zoom in on a specific tab.

<img src="img/tour_step_5.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Plots tab

The Plots menu works specifically with plots that you have made in RStudio. This menu allows you to quickly switch between plots and zoom on the plot to enhance clarity. This is where you can choose to save your plot as either an image or a PDF, as well as where you may delete unwanted plots with Remove Plot….

<img src="img/tour_step_6.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Session tab

The Session menu allows users to open a New Session… and Quit Session…. Here you may also Terminate R… if you are finished with using RStudio, or Restart R if an update needs to occur or the program needs to be refreshed.

<img src="img/tour_step_7.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Build tab

The Build menu features only one command: Configure Build Tools. Build Tools may only be configured inside of an RStudio project and are a way to package and distribute R code.

<img src="img/tour_step_8.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Debug tab

The Debug menu is what ensures your code is working correctly. When there is an error in your code or commands, the Debug menu will point out the errors and allow you to decide if you wish to keep working with your RStudio code. You may choose how you wish to be notified of an error by using the option "On Error". If you need additional help fixing an error, select Debugging Help.

<img src="img/tour_step_9.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Proflie tab

The Profile menu allows users to understand better what exactly RStudio is doing. Profiling provides a graphical interface so that users may see what RStudio is working on in moments when you are waiting for output to appear. By profiling, users can learn what is slowing their code so that they may tweak parts to make the code run faster.

<img src="img/tour_step_10.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Tools tab

The Tools menu provides information on the current version of RStudio being run, as well as being the location where Packages and Addins may be installed. Tools also assist RStudio users with Keyboard Shortcuts and allow users to Modify Keyboard Shortcuts to cater to individual’s needs and preferences.

<img src="img/tour_step_11.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**If you have any questions or stuck at any point, then please contact your instructor for the help.** 


## Initial Set-up

<!-- ### Install required packages -->

<!-- Before starting any of the assignments for the class, you need to install a set of extensions to R (called packages). -->

<!-- In the console tab, type: -->

<!-- `install.packages("tidyverse")` -->

<!-- and hit enter. This will take several minutes to finish, and you will see many lines of text flash past on the screen. The installation is finished when the console returns to the prompt symbol: `>` -->


### Change Global Options

To change the settings for RStudio Server, click Tools > Global Options… in the top menu bar. A pop-up menu will appear with many different options for you to change. You are free to explore all the different options on your own. For now, there are two things you should change:

* Uncheck the box next to **Restore .RData into workspace at startup**

* Click the drop-down menu next to **Save workspace to .RData on exit** and change the setting to *Never*

Click the **Apply** button on the lower-right of the pop-up window, followed by the **OK** button.


### Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub

A personal access token is essentially a temporary password that you can create to use with your GitHub account instead of your main account. It is much more secure than using your main GitHub password when working on GitHub projects.

Login to your account at GitHub account and follow steps 1-9 [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) under the section *Creating a Token*.

A few notes:

* In step 7, give your token a long enough expiration so that it will last past the end of the semester.
* In step 8, you only need to check the box that says **repo**.
* In step 9, **make sure you store a copy of the token** that is generated for you (e.g. copy-and-paste it into a text file). You will never be able to view this token again on GitHub, so if you lose it, you will need to create a new token by repeating steps 1-9 all over again...

Once you have created the token, return to RStudio, and move onto the next section:

### Configure RStudio for use with Git

Take a look in the bottom-left pane of RStudio. You should see a tab called *Console* which is open by default, and another one called *Terminal*. Switch to the *Terminal* tab. (If you do not see a Terminal, create one from the top menu in RStudio by going to *Tools > Terminal > New Terminal*.)

It may take a few seconds for the *Terminal* to load, but once it has done so you will see a line that ends with a dollar symbol `$` and a flashing black cursor.

Copy-and-paste the following command into the *Terminal* and then press `Enter` to run it:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Note that:

* You will not see any response in the *Terminal* if the line runs successfully. However you can check if it was successful by running this line `git config credential.helper` - you should get the response `store`.

* To paste copied text into the *Terminal* with a keyboard shortcut, use Ctrl+Shift+v on your keyboard instead of just Ctrl+v (and if you are using a Mac, use the Cmd key instead of Ctrl).

Next, switch back to the *Console* tab of the bottom left pane (next to the *Terminal* tab).

Copy-and-paste the following lines three lines of R code into the Console and hit `<Enter>`.

```
install.packages("gitcreds")
library(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set()
```

Note that in the *Console* you can use Ctrl+v to paste instead of Ctrl+Shift+v (or just Cmd+v on a Mac).

You will be prompted to enter the token that you just created above on GitHub.com. You should copy-and-paste the token from where you saved it to prevent any spelling errors, and then press `<Enter>` again.

Now you should be all set up!



## Installing and updating R packages on RStudio Server

There are two ways to install and update the packages on RStudio Server. We will learn both the techniques in this tutorial. 

### Option - 1 (Without commands)

This is the easiest option to install and update the packages on RStudio Server. You can find a list of all the installed packages on RStudio Server by clicking the Packages tab (present in the lower right window) and then to install any package click on the Install button.

<img src="img/packages_step_1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

RStudio Server will then open a new window to insert the package name which you need to install. After entering package name click on the Install button. 

<img src="img/packages_step_2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

After clicking the Install button, RStudio Server will install the package, and you will be able to see the newly installed package in the list.

<img src="img/packages_step_3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

To import any package click on the checkbox of the package. RStudio Server will automatically import the package which you have selected. Similarly to update packages you need to click on the update tab, and RStudio Server will give you a  list of packages which are outdated and ask your permission to update. 

<img src="img/packages_step_4.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Option - 2 (With commands)

You can also install and update packages by typing commands in RStudio Server Console. To install any package on RStudio Server, you need to use **install.packages("PackageName")** command in R. Example of installing "ROCR" package is shown below. The package which you need to install will get replaced by "ROCR". Also, after installing any package, the list also gets updated. (R also installs the dependent packages if needed when you install any package).

<img src="img/packages_step_5.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

To import any package in RStudio Server, you need to use **library(PacakageName)** command. Below an example of importing "ROCR" package is shown. In R, many times package gets imported along with its dependent packages.

To update all the outdated packages  **update.packages(ask = FALSE)** command is used. If you do not include **ask = False** then RStudio Server will ask your permission every time while updating the package.

<img src="img/file_step_2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Using RStudio Server to clone a Github Repo as a new project

### Step - 1

Log in to your RStudio Server account on <https://rstudio.cos.gmu.edu/>. 

<img src="img/clone_step_1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 2

In this tutorial, we will be creating a new project in RStudio Server to clone a GitHub repository. To create a new project click on the right side (cube containing R icon) button on RStudo Server screen. After clicking the button, you will see a menu and then click on "New Project...".

<img src="img/clone_step_2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 3

A new window will open and select "Version Control" option from the window.

<img src="img/clone_step_3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 4

Now, select "Git" option from the menu.

<img src="img/clone_step_4.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 5

In this step, you need to go to your GitHub account (<https://github.com>) and copy the URL of the repository which you need to clone. In this tutorial "test" repository will be used. (Please remember to copy the URL of the repository which you need to clone) 

<img src="img/clone_step_5.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 6

In the last step, you have copied the URL from GitHub. Now, paste the URL in "Repository URL" textbox. RStudio Server will automatically use the same repository name from the URL and then click on "Create Project" button. 

<img src="img/clone_step_6.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 7

You have successfully cloned a repository from GitHub in RStudio Server. After creating a project, you will be in the newly cloned repository. You can easily access the files from the repository in the lower right window. Also, if you want to verify the repository, then you can check it on right side (cube containing R icon) button in the RStudio Server. 

<img src="img/clone_step_7.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## How to stage, commit, and push to Github using RStudio Server

### Step - 1

Click on the "Git" which is present in the upper right window. After clicking the Git button, you will see a list of all files that have been changed since the last commit.

<img src="img/stage_step_3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Click on the "Staged" checkbox to stage files which you want to push to GitHub and click on the "Commit".

<img src="img/stage_step_4.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 3

A new window will open, and it will reflect you the files which you want to commit to GitHub repository. You can also write a commit message in the "Commit message" textbox and then click the "Commit" button. (DO NOT check the box which says "Amend previous commit" - this will only lead to disaster).

<img src="img/stage_step_5.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

You will see the following screen after clicking on the "Commit" button. Close the window by clicking the "Close" button. 

<img src="img/stage_step_6.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 4

After committing the files on GitHub, you will find the upper right window empty. It means that you have committed the files to the repository. Now, in the final step, you need to click on "Push" to push the files in the repository. 

<img src="img/stage_step_7.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 5

When you click the "Push" button, then RStudio Server will ask you for your GitHub username and password. Please give your details and then click on "Ok".

<img src="img/stage_step_8.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In the end, you will see a new window containing Git Push message. If everything is correct, then there will not be any errors, and your files have been successfully pushed in GitHub repository. 

<img src="img/stage_step_9.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 6

You can also crosscheck on GitHub by accessing the specific repository. 

<img src="img/stage_step_10.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In this way, you can easily stage, commit and push to GitHub using RStudio Server. If you have any questions or concerns, then please contact your advisor.

## Switching between Github repos in RStudio Server

In the last tutorial, we learned how to clone a repository from GitHub to RStudio Server. Now, we will see how to switch from one repository to another in RStudio Server. 

### Step - 1

Log in to your RStudio Server account on <https://rstudio.cos.gmu.edu/>. You can see your current repository on the right side (cube containing R icon) button on RStudo Server screen. Currently, I am working in the "rstudio-server-tutorial" repository, and there are two other repositories which I have already cloned from GitHub ("test" and "github-tutorial").

To switch from one repository to another click on the right side (cube containing R icon) button and then click on the repository which you want to access. In this case, I want to move from "rstudio-server-tutorial" repository to "test" repository. (While performing tutorial, please note that you will have different repositories) 

<img src="img/switch_step_1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Step - 2

After clicking on the name of the repository, RStudio Server will switch to the respective repository. You can verify the repository by checking its name on the right side button.

<img src="img/switch_step_2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In this way, you can quickly switch from one repository to another in RStudio Server. If a particular repository is not available in RStudio Server then first you need to clone that repository from GitHub, and then you can use that repository in RStudio Server.

## Other common questions about RStudio Server

### What happens if you close the browser tab?

RStudio Server can be accessed via web browser after authenticating the user. If you are working in RStudio Server and mistakenly close the browser, then it will not affect your computations or saved files. You will see the same screen which you have closed after starting the RStudio Server again.

### I clicked "import dataset," but I can't find the file I downloaded, where is it?

RStudio Server stores data and code files on the cloud. Whenever you will upload any new file/data or save your code in RStudio Server, then it will store those files in the cloud and not on your local drive. 

Also, please note that after uploading files you will be making changes in the files which are uploaded to the cloud. Similarly, if you are using any data set in RStudio Server, then you will be using that from the cloud. 

If you would like to have a copy of your work on your local drive, then download that by selecting the "More" tab (lower right window) and then click on "Export..."
